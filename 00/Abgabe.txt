-man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to  man  is
       normally  the  name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page
       associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A
       section,  if  provided, will direct man to look only in that section of
       the manual.  The default action is to search in all  of  the  available
       sections  following  a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl
       3am 5 4 9 6 7" by default, unless overridden by the  SECTION  directive
       in /etc/manpath.config), and to show only the first page found, even if
       page exists in several sections.


-grep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE.  A FILE of “-” stands for
       standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive  searches  examine  the
       working  directory,  and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By
       default, grep prints the matching lines.



-NAME
       cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

SYNOPSIS
       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
